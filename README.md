## notes

what is and simple example of an task for an agent to do? what i could do is to use the vacation planner as an example. like at nox - we try to plan a vacation right. nox is pretty cool, i wanna build something for them.s

hey. i want to book a flight to paris in san francisco in three days. can u do this for me? so she is asking "what to do". i am cooking. the question is can i take existing framework and use for several things. i dont have an idea on what to work on.

## roadmap

- [ ] create niche and boss agent
- [ ] create a GUI where people can create their agents with
- [ ] create an AI town simulator where agents are getting spawned inside an AI town environment like in the AI town paper
